    Website Maintenance
  </h1>

  <p class="servers-down-paragraph-type1">
    The website will be undergoing maintenance from November 12 8 AM PST through
    November 15 7 AM PST.
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="servers-down-header2">
   The Explanation
  </h2>
  <p class="server-down-paragraph-type2">
    This is happening due to us changing some things. We recently changed our page color from orange to white. We will be making the website more professional. We will have new features like the marquee (sliding words) feature and a dark mode feature. All will be coming in the next few months or so. There will be 7 outages in total. No more than that. We promise

  </p>
  
  <h2 class="server-down-header2">
    Notification
  </h2>
  <img class="servers-down-image-example" src="https://cdn.glitch.me/ec7ce55c-e94d-4bac-a94f-9639f8fbd1d1%2Fdownload%20(9).png?v=1636675222983"\
      width="250"
       height="196"><p class="server-down-paragraph-type3">
    Users will be notified when the outage occurs. They will be redirected to a page displaying our message. At that time, nobody will be able to access the website. We will also be removing the website links on our forums page to make sure nobody is able to access it. We want our update to be a surprise to users. :)
  </p>
  
  <h2 class="server-down-header2">
    Backup Website
  </h2>
  <p class="server-down-paragraph-type2">
    Users will be able to access the backup website on Replit. The Repl gets updates 2 days after the main website does to make sure everything to up to date. We are also working on a GitHub so you can access the code over there as well.
